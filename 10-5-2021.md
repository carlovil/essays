Before RadGrad, I was unaware of the many courses UH had to offer in terms of ICS classes. Aside from courses, there were also opportunities and options that we could choose that fit with the direction we want to pursue in the future. An example would be hackathons that I was not aware of and did not know where to find and thanks to RadGrad I was able to find a way to participate in not only hackathons but other interests as well that will look good on my resume. I was an avid STAR user and everything that appeared on STAR was a class I should take but knowing that there were other courses out there that I can take from using RadGrad it helped me gain a sense of direction into what I want to be in the future, which is being a game developer.
It was interesting to see how many people were also participating in RadGrad, with many of whom I am familiar with working with. The site was quite expansive, and there were three levels such as experience, competency, and innovation that helps you gauge the amount of experience you get in each category and how much you lack / need. The vast amounts of courses you choose shows how much experience, competency, and innovation you gain from taking it and I think that itâ€™s a helpful tool to make sure you are well rounded in all areas. There are also tags under each course that match with what you are interested in making it so that the courses you take are well worth your time. This is important because I would not want to go into a course not knowing what I am going to learn about and the concepts learned would be useful for the potential job I am searching for in the future.
Overall, RadGrad is a great site for discovering what you want to be in the future as an ICS student. Looking at the spectrum that is ICS, there were many fields that I encountered and at first it made me so lost but RadGrad assisted in giving me a path to take. The opportunities offered and extra curricular activities to do outside of the classroom helps me build a good profile in order for me to get a well paying job in the years to come.
